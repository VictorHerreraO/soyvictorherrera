					<p><strong>Log Data</strong></p>
					<p>
						I want to inform you that whenever you
						use my Service, in a case of an error in the app
						I collect data and information (through third-party
						products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
						include information such as your device Internet Protocol
						(“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the
						configuration of the app when utilizing my Service,

						Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
						commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
						to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
						stored on your device's internal memory.

						This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,

						<li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						I want to inform users of this Service
						that these third parties have access to their Personal
						Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
						them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
						disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
					<p>
						I value your trust in providing us your
						Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
						acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
						of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
						storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
						guarantee its absolute security.
